There are 5 elements of IMINT that you should consider when looking at an image, according to Geoint expert [Benjamin Strick](https://twitter.com/BenDoBrown):

- Context
- Foreground
- Background
- Map markings
- Trial and error

A geolocation challenge like this lacks one important factor, which is the context or the source of the image. In real-world cases, you usually have a context in which the image was produced or shared, usually called context clues.

**Here are some questions you should ask yourself while looking at imgs:**

- Are there any obvious data in the image that reveals the location, like a street name or storefront signs?
- Can you determine the country or region of the image by, for instance, which side of the road they drive on, language or architectural characteristics that may reveal a country or continent/region?
- Do you recognize road sign styles, nature and environmental characteristics, or popular motor vehicle brands or vehicle types?
- What is the quality of any visible infrastructure like? Is the road paved or do you see gravel roads?
- Do you see any unique landmarks, buildings, bridges, statues or mountains that can help you geolocate the image?
