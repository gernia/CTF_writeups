```
We see the copyright is by OWoodflint.

## Step 2: Search for OWoodflint

Searching on google for OWoodflint gives us an X account [@OWoodflint](https://x.com/owoodflint) and a github account [OWoodfl1nt](https://github.com/OWoodfl1nt).

## Step 3: The X Account

On the X account, the users profile picture is a cat, so we can answer the question **What is this user's avatar of?** with **cat**.  
From the X account, we get the BSSID of the WAP the user is connected to: B4:5D:50:AA:86:41  
We can put it into [WiGLE](https://wigle.net/) and get the SSID **UnileverWiFi** to answer the question **What is the SSID of the WAP he connected to?**.

## Step 4: The GitHub Account

On there, we find the e-mail address **OWoodflint@gmail.com** in the people_finder repository to answer the question **What is his personal email address?**.  
The user states in his repo, that he is from **London** so we can answer **What city is this person in?**.  
Also in this repo, we can see that the user has a [blog](https://oliverwoodflint.wordpress.com/).

## Step 5: The Blog

Here, we can see that the user is currently in **New York** to answer the question **Where has he gone on holiday?**.  
Inspecting the source code of the blog (or using ctrl+a), we can see that he accidentally posted his password in white text: **pennYDr0pper.!**
